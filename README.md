## üéØ About

The Fuzzy MADM Framework Analyzer is a research-grade tool that applies advanced decision-making algorithms to evaluate and rank web development frameworks. By leveraging GitHub's extensive repository data and fuzzy logic principles, it provides objective, data-driven insights for framework selection decisions.

### Key Methodology

- **Fuzzy Logic**: Handles uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making
- **Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM)**: Evaluates frameworks across multiple criteria
- **Triangular Fuzzy Numbers**: Represents linguistic variables with mathematical precision
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches live statistics from GitHub API

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç Comprehensive Analysis
- **Multi-criteria Evaluation**: Analyzes frameworks based on popularity, community support, maintenance activity, and maturity
- **Fuzzy Logic Processing**: Converts crisp values to fuzzy numbers for uncertainty handling
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Automatically identifies and filters web development frameworks
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches current GitHub statistics including stars, forks, issues, and update frequency

### üìä Advanced Visualizations
- **Interactive Charts**: Bar charts, radar plots, and pie charts for comprehensive data visualization
- **Ranking Tables**: Sortable and paginated results with detailed metrics
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time analysis progress with detailed status updates
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing

### üìà Export & Reporting
- **PDF Export**: Generate professional reports with charts and detailed rankings
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Include executive summaries, key insights, and detailed analysis
- **Chart Integration**: Embed high-quality visualizations in exported documents

### üîß Technical Features
- **GitHub API Integration**: Secure API key management with rate limit monitoring
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient data processing and caching
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and user feedback
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, intuitive interface with smooth animations

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- GitHub Personal Access Token

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itslanaa/PickMyFramework.git
   cd PickMyFramework
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### GitHub API Setup

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select the following scopes:
   - `public_repo` (for accessing public repository data)
4. Copy the generated token
5. Enter the token in the application when prompted

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be available in the `dist` directory.

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Enter GitHub API Key**: Provide your GitHub personal access token for enhanced rate limits
2. **Automatic Analysis**: The system automatically searches and filters web development frameworks
3. **View Results**: Explore rankings, charts, and detailed metrics
4. **Export Reports**: Generate PDF reports for documentation and sharing

### Analysis Criteria

The application evaluates frameworks based on four key attributes:

- **Popularity** (Weight: 0.2-0.4): GitHub stars and general adoption
- **Community** (Weight: 0.15-0.35): Forks, watchers, and community engagement
- **Maintenance** (Weight: 0.25-0.45): Recent updates and active development
- **Maturity** (Weight: 0.1-0.3): Project age and stability indicators

### Fuzzy Logic Implementation

The system uses triangular fuzzy numbers with five linguistic levels:
- **Excellent**: (0.7, 1.0, 1.0)
- **Good**: (0.5, 0.7, 0.9)
- **Fair**: (0.3, 0.5, 0.7)
- **Poor**: (0.1, 0.3, 0.5)
- **Very Poor**: (0.0, 0.0, 0.3)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with enhanced IDE support
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server

### Data Visualization
- **Chart.js**: Powerful charting library for interactive visualizations
- **React Chart.js 2**: React wrapper for Chart.js integration

### Export & Reporting
- **jsPDF**: Client-side PDF generation
- **html2canvas**: HTML to canvas conversion for chart embedding

### Icons & UI
- **Lucide React**: Beautiful, customizable SVG icons
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint optimization

## üìä API Reference

### GitHub API Integration

The application uses the GitHub REST API v3 with the following endpoints:

- `GET /search/repositories`: Search for repositories with specific criteria
- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}`: Get detailed repository information

### Rate Limits

- **Without Authentication**: 60 requests per hour
- **With Personal Access Token**: 5,000 requests per hour
